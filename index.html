          <h1>SEVER is the path to a decentralized future in the Arctic frontier.</h1>
          <p>Our excesses are altering the Earth’s climate. Polar ice is melting at a fast and irreversible pace. As the planet’s coastlines become engulfed, a new ocean is emerging, across which the globe will be rewired.</p>
          <p>The Arctic, the world’s last frontier, deserves a future brighter than our past.</p>

          <h1>SEVER is a new location-based token whose value increases with the latitude at which it is used.</h1>
          <p>SEVER’s location-sensitive architecture is designed to incentivise an influx of capital to the Arctic region. Anyone, anywhere, can purchase SVR tokens; but their optimal economic value is reached when they are used or stored above the Arctic Circle.</p>
          <p>As a cryptocurrency, it uses a new proof-of-location protocol to verify transactions. In order to guarantee the privacy of its users, only the latitude of the sender and receiver is stored in the details of each transaction. Variations of latitude between users are translated into micro-fluctuation of balances, rewarding transactions that move north.</p>
          <p>By mediating the encounter between blockchain technology and physical space, SEVER opens up a field of infinite applications. Specifically, it paves the way for a new generation of geo-targeted development projects based on the design of money itself.</p>

          <h1>SEVER is a strategy for a networked and responsible Arctic development.</h1>
          <p>While deeply embedded in crypto-economic logics, SEVER bets on alliance with existing governmental structures, rather than opposition to them. With stable institutional support, SEVER can emerge as a local currency for the Arctic region – thereby fostering exchanges and cooperation among Arctic countries, and supporting the emergence of a circular, networked Arctic economy.</p>
          <p>Promised by the now distorted geophysics of the planet, as well as much anticipated by many local and indigenous communities, the development of economic activities in the Arctic will require a new territorial-scale infrastructure. Rather than resisting with no leverage, SEVER proposes to outpace the murky and irresolute plans of development drawn so far by competing nation-states and corporations.</p>
          <p>Through the open portals of crypto-economics, clever and forward-looking projects are capable of rising vast amounts of capital very quickly. With the right incentives – for example, SVR tokens functioning as a compensation scheme to keep Arctic oil in the ground – SEVER can deliver the initial capital to kickstart a clean, traceable, and responsible Arctic development.</p>

          <h1>SEVER is an infrastructure for a fully-automated, post-work future.</h1>
          <p>SEVER positions itself along an auspicious alignment: from logistics to energy, through data management, mining, or fishing, the same industries that are starting to reconfigure their operations around blockchain technology are the ones that will benefit the most from an open Arctic.</p>
          <p>As a common, distributed database for the Arctic, SEVER’s blockchain greatly supports the development of automation across industries, as well as the interoperability among autonomous machines. Most importantly, the auditable character of SEVER’s blockchain will ensure the transparency of every automated operations, and guarantee the respect of working standards and codes in the environmentally sensitive context of the Arctic.</p>
          <p>From an impoverished region at the margins of global economic flows, the Arctic may turn, in a matter of one or two decades, into the experimental frontier where a post-scarcity, post-work society is first trialled.</p>

          <h1>SEVER is a first step towards cities owned and run by their users.</h1>
          <p>In terms of economic output, the promises of automation lie in the constant optimisation of operational procedures – finely lubricated by machine learning algorithms in order to shorten and accelerate the global supply chain. An Arctic that runs at the forefront of automation would lend itself quite naturally to a further experiment: from a decentralized autonomous economy, to a decentralized autonomous governance.</p>
          <p>Just like it was largely crowdfunded through a process of initial tokenisation, the physical infrastructure of future Arctic cities will be run by its shareholding citizens. The location sensitive protocol makes all the difference here: while distributed, capital raised through SEVER nonetheless sticks to the Arctic circle, thereby providing crypto-economics with a narrow territorial bandwidth to ground its principles and test out its true potential.</p>
          <p>As the SEVER blockchain feeds on more and more data, it will establish itself as the spinal cord of increasingly sentient urban network. Renegotiation of the relation between cities and states will become inevitable as, once mature, the economic output of such an automated urban network could rise exponentially if allowed to run free. Higher taxes will buy such decentralised northern cities a greater degree of autonomy from their host country;</p>
          <p>Delimited zones will need to be carved out from the sole sovereignty of states. Far from isolating them, the boundaries of the Arctic DACs will foster exchanges along meridian lines, by creating differentials to be bridged. Strong of its inevitable success, the SEVER model will soon spread contagiously.</p>
